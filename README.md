If you want to run the website, you can type the following code in the terminal python manage.py runserver 
When the surver runs you can go to the IP http://127.0.0.1:8000 and try different URLs 
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ this takes you to the admin page where you log in using the following:
username: Admin
password: 1__sehir__1
There you can see the tables of the databases, where you can edit and add items using the server interface
You can also call a function using http://127.0.0.1:8000/PlacesV/ and you will get an HTTP response telling you the orders of the countries
